Day 1 (8 Feb): I look forward to developing a more robust (well, any) GitHub portfolio, and exploring AI/ML as a possible focus within the Computer Science major. Since I'm not starting from much of a background in either, I look forward to learning as much as I can. I am also taking an introductory AI course at my university, and hope this program will complement it well.

Day 2 (9 Feb): The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that supervised learning consists of giving known data (that is, the data and the outcomes are already known) to the machine from which to learn and unsupervised learning consists of giving data without known outcomes to the machine from which to derive patterns. 
Scikit-learn does not have the power to visualize data Graphviz/Pandas/etc. because it is built for machine learning/data modelling; the assumption is that it can derive data visualization functionalities from other libraries (as in the aforementioned).
