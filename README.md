Day 1 (8 Feb): I look forward to developing a more robust GitHub portfolio, and exploring AI/ML as a possible focus within the Computer Science major. Since I'm not starting from much of a background in either, I look forward to learning as much as I can. I am also taking an introductory AI course at my university, and hope this program will complement it well.
