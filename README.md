Day 1 (8 Feb): I look forward to developing a more robust (well, any) GitHub portfolio, and exploring AI/ML as a possible focus within the Computer Science major. Since I'm not starting from much of a background in either, I look forward to learning as much as I can. I am also taking an introductory AI course at my university, and hope this program will complement it well.

Day 2 (9 Feb): The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that supervised learning consists of giving known data (that is, the data and the outcomes are already known) to the machine from which to learn and unsupervised learning consists of giving data without known outcomes to the machine from which to derive patterns. 
Scikit-learn does not have the power to visualize data Graphviz/Pandas/etc. because it is built for machine learning/data modelling; the assumption is that it can derive data visualization functionalities from other libraries (as in the aforementioned). 

Day 3 (10 Feb): Tensors are basically multidimensional arrays. In machine learning, ANN's operate on these arrays (data); that is, the tensors, which store data, are transformed through the ANN's.

Day 4 (11 Feb): There is a dataset on brainwaves (https://www.kaggle.com/wanghaohan/confused-eeg) which I found interesting; while the sample is small, looking at them may help address deficiencies in education (on any scale, whether instances or systems, and in any setting, whether classroom or training, etc.).

Day 9 (16 Feb): The game used machine learning to mimic the hiring decisions; the program took the manually made decisions as input, noted patterns, and then attempted to replicate them in its own process. One example of a biased machine learning model is in technology which responds to human voices (things like Siri, Alexa, etc.), which have been shown to respond better to male voices, having been trained more heavily with those. Another example is automated photographs at the airport which produce errors when faced with Asian faces, believing their eyes to be closed, probably having been trained on heavily European (or at least non-Asian) facial features.

Day 10 (17 Feb): In a fully-connected neural network, every node in one layer is connected to every node in the next layer. In convolutional neural networks, the number of nodes is reduced across a layer. They are used primarily for processing images.

Day 16 (23 Feb): The advantages to ReLU are that it is simple to implement and doesn't suffer from vanishing gradients; it's good for both MLP's and CNN's, for regression problems.

Day 22 (1 Mar): These big NLP models, like any "AI", are crafted by and for, and are modelled after, human beings. When based on reality, they will learn to perpetuate that reality, including all of its flaws. While it's great and all to notice this, and perhaps some issues are more simply solved than others, it begs the question of who dictates what is ethical? Americans are vehemently anti-censorship (at least, they think they are), so, where does this lie? It may depend on the prevalence of the technology in the future and the political motion up until that point (I would expect the latter to move more slowly). (In my own opinion, it's fine and necessary.)

Day 24 (3 Mar): Applications of affective computing include psychotherapy, or social work-- in particular, working with people with afflictions like trauma, depression, bipolar disorder, etc. Not only could it help understand these, it could help monitor and thus address/resolve (for both parties).
